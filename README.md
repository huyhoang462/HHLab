## üí° About The Project

**HH-Lab** is more than just a project; it's my personal development laboratory. It was born out of a desire to create a clean, focused, and highly personalized workspace that helps me stay productive, while also serving as a playground to experiment with and master modern frontend technologies.

The name "HH-Lab" reflects this dual purpose:

- **HH:** Stands for my name, marking this as my personal space.
- **Lab:** Represents a laboratory where I can build, test, and refine features, applying best practices in architecture, state management, and UI/UX design.

The core philosophy is to build a beautiful, functional, and performant application that I, myself, would love to use every day.

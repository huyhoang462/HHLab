## üí° About The Project

**HH-Lab** is more than just a project; it's my personal development laboratory. It was born out of a desire to create a clean, focused, and highly personalized workspace that helps me stay productive, while also serving as a playground to experiment with and master modern frontend technologies.

## ‚ú® Core Features

This project showcases a collection of key features built with modern React practices, focusing on clean code, component-based architecture, and a great user experience.

- **Responsive Layout & Routing:**

  - Built a fully responsive user interface using **Tailwind CSS** that adapts seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
  - Implemented client-side routing with **React Router DOM** to create a smooth single-page application experience.

- **To-Do List:**

  - Managed the application's entire to-do state using **Redux Toolkit**, ensuring predictable state updates.
  - Integrated with **Local Storage** to persist user data, so tasks are saved between sessions.

- **Pomodoro Timer:**

  - Engineered a functional Pomodoro timer with configurable work and break sessions to help users manage their focus.
  - Utilized the `useEffect` hook to handle the timer's countdown logic and automatic session switching.

- **Global Theming & Language:**
  - Implemented a site-wide light/dark theme switcher using a custom hook built on top of **React's Context API**.
  - Integrated **i18next** to provide multi-language support (English/Vietnamese), also managed via the Context API.
